Hey there! My name is YiFan Xiong, you can also call me Ewan, which is my English name. I'm now a Bioinformatic engineer at [Dynamic Biosystems](http://www.dynamic-biosystems.com/). My work primarily focuses on analysing Single-cell and Spatial Omics data produced by Well-Paired-Seq and DynaSpatial platforms, and development software tools for analyses. I’m also enthusiastic about developing R package for data visualization. 

My Research Interests
======
I am passionate about applying bioinformatic methods to the field of biology, especially Precision Medicine in dieases. Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) is easily available now, we can have access to high-throughput sequencing data with less effort and difficulties. We can build up complex networks combined with multi-Omics data to explore varieties of biological questions. I think wet experiments are the backbones of Biology, but bioinformatics bring us much data-driven breakthrough and high-dimentional perspective. So that, we can accomplish biological questions with better efficiency and productivity.I also care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science research.
