Hi there! My name is Yifan Xiong. After completing my MS degree in 2022, I gained two years of industry experience as a Bioinformatics Engineer. I returned to academia because research offers me greater **fulfillment** and aligns more with my **interests**. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in [XGlab](http://eca.xglab.tech/member/index.html) at Tsinghua University. I am eager to apply state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods to explore meaningful biological questions and have a strong interest in machine learning. Now, I am seeking opportunities to **pursue a Ph.D**. to achieve my goal of becoming a bioinformatics scientist. Here is the [CV](https://ewanxiong.github.io/files/YifanXiong_CV.pdf) for my detailed professional background and research experience.



My Research Interests
======
My research interests are now focus on **precision medicine** for human diseases. After experiencing the COVID pandemic, I have been constantly thinking about using bioinformatics to make data-driven breakthroughs in understanding and treating human diseases. Machine learning and multi-omics technologies have ushered in a new era of AI-driven and cross-modal research paradigms. This marks a significant step toward gaining deeper insights into biomedical science, particularly in precision medicine. Inspired by the motto, "Keep looking, never settle," I am eager to apply bioinformatics methods to the realm of precision medicine, aiming to help people with less effort and difficulty.

Furthermore, I am committed to promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible scientific research.
