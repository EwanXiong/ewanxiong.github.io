Hey there! My name is YiFan Xiong. You can also call me Ewan, which is easier to pronounce. I'm now a Bioinformatic engineer at [Dynamic Biosystems](http://www.dynamic-biosystems.com/). My work primarily focuses on analysing Single-cell and Spatial Omics data produced Well-Paired-Seq and DynaSpatial platform, and development software tools for supporting. Iâ€™m also enthusiastic about developing R package for data visualization. 

My Research Interests
======
I am passionate about applying bioinformatic methods to the field of Precision Medicine. 
I care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science research.
