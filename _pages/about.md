Hi there! My name is Yifan Xiong. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in [XGlab](http://eca.xglab.tech/member/index.html) at Tsinghua University. I'm also an incoming PhD student in the Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics ([GGB](https://genetics.ucr.edu/)) program at the University of California Riverside, starting in Fall 2025.



My Research Interests
======
My research interests are now focus on **precision medicine** for human diseases. After experiencing the COVID pandemic, I have been constantly thinking about using bioinformatics to make data-driven breakthroughs in understanding and treating human diseases. Machine learning and multi-omics technologies have ushered in a new era of AI-driven and cross-modal research paradigms. This marks a significant step toward gaining deeper insights into biomedical science, particularly in precision medicine. Inspired by the motto, "Keep looking, never settle," I am eager to apply bioinformatics methods to the realm of precision medicine, aiming to help people with less effort and difficulty.

Furthermore, I am committed to promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible scientific research.
