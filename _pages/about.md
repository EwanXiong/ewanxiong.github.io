Hello! My name is YiFan Xiong. I currently work as a Research Assistant at [XGlab](http://eca.xglab.tech/member/index.html) at TsingHua University. In my role, I specialize in analyzing Multi-Omics data and using Machine Learning to evaluate the biological meaning behind the data. Additionally, I like to develop software tools for data analysis and also enthusiastic about developing packages for data visualization. 

My Research Interests
======
I'm deeply passionate about applying bioinformatics methods to the field of biology, particularly in the realm of Precision Medicine. With NGS data becoming increasingly accessible, a huge number of sequencing data is now readily available with less effort and difficulty. This enables us to investigate a wide range of biological questions with data-driven breakthroughs.

While I recognize that wet experiments are the foundation of Biology researches, I firmly believe that bioinformatics plays a crucial role and providing a high-dimensional perspective. As a result, we can address biological questions with greater efficiency and productivity.

Furthermore, I am committed to promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible scientific research.

Contect Me
======
Please feel free to reach out to me at any time. If you have any questions or would like to discuss anything further, I'm always happy to chat.
