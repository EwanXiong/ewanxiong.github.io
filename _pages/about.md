Hello! I'm YiFan Xiong, you can also call me Ewan, which is my English name. I currently work as a Bioinformatics Engineer at [Dynamic Biosystems](http://www.dynamic-biosystems.com/). In my role, I specialize in analyzing Multi-Omics data, especially Single-cell data. Additionally, I develop software tools for data analysis and also enthusiastic about developing R packages for data visualization. 

My Research Interests
======
I'm deeply passionate about applying bioinformatics methods to the field of biology, particularly in the realm of Precision Medicine for diseases. With Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) becoming increasingly accessible, high-throughput sequencing data is now readily available with less effort and difficulty. This enables us to construct complex networks by integrating multi-omics data to investigate a wide range of biological questions.

While I recognize that wet experiments are the foundation of Biology, I firmly believe that bioinformatics plays a crucial role in driving data-driven breakthroughs and providing a high-dimensional perspective. As a result, we can address biological questions with greater efficiency and productivity.

Furthermore, I am committed to promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible scientific research.

Contect Me
